✅ RESOLVED: 1. Autoplay on hover should not happen when I hover on the swiper navigation buttons, i should be able to click on the previous or next buttons and control what i want to view. Autoplay on hover should only happen when I hover on the swiper-container.
   - Fixed by changing hover event listeners from carousel element to swiper-container element in view.js

✅ RESOLVED: 2. I noticed that when i select mulitple slides on the gutenberg editor, I get this error
   - Fixed by wrapping setAttributes call in useEffect hook to avoid React state updates during render in carousel-slide/edit.js
